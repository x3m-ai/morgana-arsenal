name: AV detections related to SpringShell Vulnerability
description: "This query looks for Microsoft Defender AV detections related to the\
  \ SpringShell vulnerability. In Microsoft Sentinel, the SecurityAlerts table includes\
  \ only the Device Name of the affected device.\n  This query joins the DeviceInfo\
  \ table to clearly connect other information such as device group, IP, logged-on\
  \ users, etc. This would allow the Microsoft Sentinel analyst to have more context\
  \ related to the alert, if available.\n  Reference: https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/04/04/springshell-rce-vulnerability-guidance-for-protecting-against-and-detecting-cve-2022-22965/\
