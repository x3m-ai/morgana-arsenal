description: "This detection uses Sysmon events (NetworkConnect events) to detect\
  \ incoming network traffic on port 80 on AD FS servers. This could be a sign of\
  \ a threat actor trying to use replication services on the AD FS server to get its\
  \ configuration settings and extract sensitive information such as AD FS certificates.\n\
  In order to use this query you need to enable Sysmon telemetry on the AD FS Server.\n\
