name: Advanced Multistage Attack Detection
description: "Microsoft Sentinel uses Fusion, a correlation engine based on scalable\
  \ machine learning algorithms, to automatically detect multistage attacks by identifying\
  \ combinations of anomalous behaviors and suspicious activities that are observed\
  \ at various stages of the kill chain. On the basis of these discoveries, Azure\
  \ Sentinel generates incidents that would otherwise be very difficult to catch.\
  \ By design, these incidents are low-volume, high-fidelity, and high-severity, which\
  \ is why this detection is turned ON by default.\n\nSince Fusion correlates multiple\
  \ signals from various products to detect advanced multistage attacks, successful\
  \ Fusion detections are presented as Fusion incidents on the Microsoft Sentinel\
  \ Incidents page. This rule covers the following detections:\n- Fusion for emerging\
  \ threats\n- Fusion for ransomware\n- Scenario-based Fusion detections (122 scenarios)\n\
  \nTo enable these detections, we recommend you configure the following data connectors\
  \ for best results:\n- Out-of-the-box anomaly detections\n- Microsoft Entra ID Protection\n\
  - Azure Defender\n- Azure Defender for IoT\n- Microsoft 365 Defender\n- Microsoft\
  \ Cloud App Security    \n- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint\n- Microsoft Defender\
  \ for Identity\n- Microsoft Defender for Office 365\n- Scheduled analytics rules,\
  \ both built-in and those created by your security analysts. Analytics rules must\
  \ contain kill-chain (tactics) and entity mapping information in order to be used\
  \ by Fusion.\n\nFor the full description of each detection that is supported by\
  \ Fusion, go to https://aka.ms/SentinelFusion. (Generated by Merlino)"
