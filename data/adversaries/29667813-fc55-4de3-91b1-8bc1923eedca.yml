name: AD FS Remote Auth Sync Connection
description: 'This detection uses Security events from the "AD FS Auditing" provider
  to detect suspicious authentication events on an AD FS server. The results then
  get correlated with events from the Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) to detect suspicious
  incoming network traffic on port 80 on the AD FS server.

  This could be a sign of a threat actor trying to use replication services on the
  AD FS server to get its configuration settings and extract sensitive information
  such as AD FS certificates. In order to use this query you need to enable AD FS
  auditing on the AD FS Server.
