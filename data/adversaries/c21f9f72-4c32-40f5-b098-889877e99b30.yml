name: AD user enabled and password not set within 48 hours
description: 'Identifies when an account is enabled with a default password and the
  password is not set by the user within 48 hours.

  Effectively, there is an event 4722 indicating an account was enabled and within
  48 hours, no event 4723 occurs which

  indicates there was no attempt by the user to set the password. This will show any
  attempts (success or fail) that occur

  after 48 hours, which can indicate too long of a time period in setting the password
  to something that only the user knows.

  It is recommended that this time period is adjusted per your internal company policy.
