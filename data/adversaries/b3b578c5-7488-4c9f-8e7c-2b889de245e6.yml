description: "This query looks for Microsoft Defender AV detections related to Tarrask\
  \ malware. In Microsoft Sentinel, the SecurityAlerts table includes only the Device\
  \ Name of the affected device, this query joins the DeviceInfo table to clearly\
  \ connect other information such as Device group, ip, logged-on users etc. \n This\
  \ would allow the Microsoft Sentinel analyst to have more context related to the\
  \ alert, if available.\n Reference: https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/04/12/tarrask-malware-uses-scheduled-tasks-for-defense-evasion/\
