name: Non Domain Controller Active Directory Replication
description: 'This query detects potential attempts by non-computer accounts (non
  domain controllers) to retrieve/synchronize an active directory object leveraging
  directory replication services (DRS).

  A Domain Controller (computer account) would usually be performing these actions
  in a domain environment. Another detection rule can be created to cover domain controllers
  accounts doing at rare times.

  A domain user with privileged permissions to use directory replication services
  is rare. (Generated by Merlino)'
