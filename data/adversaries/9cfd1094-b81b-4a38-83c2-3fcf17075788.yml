name: Office Apps Launching Wscipt
description: 'This query was originally published in the threat analytics report,
  Trickbot: Pervasive & underestimated.

  Trickbot is a very prevalent piece of malware with an array of malicious capabilities.
  Originally designed to steal banking credentials, it has since evolved into a modular
  trojan that can deploy other malware, disable security software, and perform command-and-control
  (C2) operations.

  Trickbot is frequently spread through email. An attacker will send a target a message
  with an attachment containing a malicious macro. If the target enables the macro,
  it will write a JScript Encoded (JSE) file to disk (JScript is a Microsoft dialect
  of ECMAScript). The JSE file will then be launched using wscript.exe to perform
  a variety of malicious tasks, particularly reconnaissance.

  The following query detects when Office applications have launched wscript.exe to
  run a JSE file.

  See Detect rundll.exe being used for reconnaissance and command-and-control for
  another query related to Trickbot activity.
