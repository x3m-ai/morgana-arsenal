name: SecurityEvent - Multiple authentication failures followed by a success
description: 'Identifies accounts who have failed to logon to the domain multiple
  times in a row, followed by a successful authentication within a short time frame.
  Multiple failed attempts followed by a success can be an indication of a brute force
  attempt or possible mis-configuration of a service account within an environment.

  The lookback is set to 2h and the authentication window and threshold are set to
  1h and 5, meaning we need to see a minimum of 5 failures followed by a success for
  an account within 1 hour to surface an alert. (Generated by Merlino)'
