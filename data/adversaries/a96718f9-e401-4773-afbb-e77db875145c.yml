name: Service Accounts Performing Remote PS
description: 'Service Accounts Performing Remote PowerShell.

  The purpose behind this detection is for finding service accounts that are performing
  remote powershell sessions.

  There are two phases to the detection: Identify service accounts, Find remote PS
  cmdlets being ran by these accounts.

  To accomplish this, we utilize DeviceLogonEvents and DeviceEvents to find cmdlets
  ran that meet the criteria.

  One of the main advantages of this method is that only requires server telemetry,
  and not the attacking client.

  The first phase relies on the DeviceLogonEvents to determine whether an account
  is a service account or not, consider the following accounts with logons:.

  Random_user has DeviceLogonEvents with type 2, 3, 7, 10, 11 & 13.

  Random_service_account ''should'' only have DeviceLogonEvents with type 3,4 or 5.
